# Online Courses Usage and History Dataset
## Overview
This dataset contains information about various online courses, including their categories, durations, enrolled students, completion rates, 
platforms, prices, and ratings. It provides insights into the popularity and effectiveness of online courses across different platforms.

## Data Description
The dataset includes the following columns:

1. Course_ID: Unique identifier for each course.
2. Course_Name: Name of the course.
3. Category: Category of the course (e.g., Office Tools, Technology).
4. Duration (hours): Total duration of the course in hours.
5. Enrolled_Students: Number of students enrolled in the course.
6. Completion_Rate (%): Percentage of students who completed the course.
7. Platform: Platform where the course is offered (e.g., Coursera, edX, LinkedIn Learning, Udemy).
8. Price ($): Price of the course in USD.
9. Rating (out of 5): Average rating of the course.

## Learning outcomes

The "Online Courses Usage and History" dataset can be used for both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, but it primarily aligns with supervised learning. 
This is because it contains labeled data that can be used to train models to predict outcomes based on other features.

For instance:
Supervised Learning:
Predicting the Completion_Rate (%) based on features like Category, Duration (hours), Enrolled_Students, Platform, Price ($), and Rating (out of 5).
Predicting the Rating (out of 5) based on similar features.

However, you can also use this dataset for unsupervised learning tasks, such as clustering courses based on categories, platforms, or pricing to identify patterns or groupings.

Therefore, while the dataset can be used for both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, its primary use case aligns more with supervised learning.
